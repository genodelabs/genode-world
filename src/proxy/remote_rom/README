The remote ROM allows providing ROM services over a network or similar communication
medium and thus implements publisher/subscriber communication in a distributed system.

The remote_rom server connects to a local ROM service and provides a remote ROM service
via the specified backend. The remote_rom client connects to a remote ROM service via
the specified backend and provides a ROM service via local RPC.

Backends
--------

The remote_rom can be compiled with one of multiple back ends that use different session
interfaces or libraries to forward and receive the packets. By exchanging the backend,
we can also easily change the publication strategy (e.g., notification+polling vs. multicast).
Furthermore, a back end is responsible for access control and optionally allows the
specification of a policy for this.

:'nic_ip':
  This back end uses a Nic_session to transmit network packets with IPv4 headers.

Configuration
-------------

Both the client and the server evaluate the '<remote_rom>' node of their config.
The _name_ attribute specifies the ROMs module name. The '<remote_rom>' node may
further contain a '<default>' node that can be used to populate the ROM with a default
content.

Example
